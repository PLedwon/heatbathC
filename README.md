# heatbathCpp

Trying to simulate superdiffusive behaviour for a distinguished particle in a Kac-Zwanzig-heatbath. 
The bath consists of harmonic oscillators, coupled to the distinguished particle. By choosing a fitting spring constant distribution, the bath properties can be manipulated.   

The bath is initiated in thermal equilibrium, the initial positions and momenta are drawn from a gaussian distribution. By repeating the simulation with random initial conditions, the variance of the distinguished particle can be determined statistically.
